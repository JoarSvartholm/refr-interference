% TODO: fixa röda tråden mellan metoden och utförandet.

The experimental setup used to measure the index of refraction for various gases is illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:experimentalSetup}. The HeNe-laser beam is divided into two legs, reference leg $L_1$ and signal leg $L_2$ via a beam splitter (BS). The ray travelling down the signal leg is transmitted through a gas chamber made of acryllic glas, with inner length $d=100(1)$ mm. It is then reflected via a mirror back through the gas chamber and reflected on the beam splitter where it coincides with the other part of the ray (from the reference leg). The recombined laser beam propagates through a small apperature in order to eliminate unwanted reflections created by the equipment. The united ray also reaches a lens which diverge the rays in order to increase the resolution of the interference pattern obtained. A photodiode is mounted after the lens in order to pick up any changes of incident intensity of the combined laser beam. In order to eliminate ethalons inside the gas chamber, it was mounted at an angle relative to the incident laser beam.

  %\caption{Experimental setup. The laser beam is split into two rays at the beam splitter. One ray propagates in the reference leg (L$_1$) and is reflected back to the beam splitter. The other ray that was split at the beam splitter, propagates in to the signal leg (L$_2$) via a gas chamber to a mirror and reflected back the same way to the beam splitter. The two rays coincide at the beam splitter again and propagates through an apperature and a lens and illuminates a photodiode. The two rays will interfere with eachother and an interferance pattern will emerge.}

The photodiode is connected to an operational amplifier with a low pass filter with a cut off frequency of 35Hz in order to amplify the signal and reduce noise in the circut. The data acquisition card (DAQ) retrives the amplified signal from the photodiode and a signal from a pressure sensor in the gas chamber.

The pressure signal was calibrated using a pressure gauge and the calibration curve is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:calibration}. A linear fit was done and the fitting parameters are found in Table \ref{tab:calibration}
%The linear fit on the calibration measurement was calculated in by linear least squares in MATLAB, the fitted line has the equation $P = 12.5(2)V+25.6(1)$.

The two legs were aligned properly in order to see a interference pattern at the photodiode with high resolution and contrast. The gas chamber was filled with gas from vaccum and the intensity at the photodiode and the pressure in the gas chamber was measured continuously. Then by counting the fringes (intensity peaks at the photodiode) the index of refraction was calculated via Eq. \ref{eq:refrVaccum} and Eq. \ref{eq:slope}.

%, an interferance pattern will emerge on the photodiode. If vaccum is created inside the gas chamber and then a steady flow of gas added, the optical path will increase. An interferance pattern (fringes) on the photodiode  will start to move continuously. By measuring the intensity changes on the photodiode and relating this to the pressure change in the gas chamber, one can calculate the index of refraction via Eq. \ref{eq:refrVaccum} and Eq. \ref{eq:slope}.



In order to estimate the error of $a =\Delta N/ \Delta P$ from Eq. \ref{eq:slope}, the errors of $\Delta N$ and $\Delta P$ was estimated to $S_{\Delta N}=0.5$ and $S_{\Delta P}=0.1$ kPa. By fitting two lines that are inside these errors for all measurements, with as large slope/small slope as possible. These slopes will serve as the error estimates of $a$.
