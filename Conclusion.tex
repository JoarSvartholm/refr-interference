\section{Conclusion}


The measured refractive indices was slightly off the tabulated. All but the one for helium was lower than the tabulated value which indicates that there might have been a systematic error in the measurents. This might be due to that the vaccum pump wasn't able to create perfect vaccum and thus introduced a shift. This was not seen in the measurements of helium since the relative error of the other error sources was larger and thus making this shift invisible in the results.
