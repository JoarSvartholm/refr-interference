The 2017's Nobel price in physics was awarded to the group who confirmed Einstein's theory about gravitational waves. These waves was detected via an enormous interfermoeter. An interfermoeter can measure very small changes in optical paths and works by utilizing coherant light and the physical phenomena of interference. 

Light is the fastest moving thing know to humans, it travels at $299.792.458$ m/s in vaccum. This speed actually depends on the matter i travels in, for example, in water the speed is only $75\%$ compared to vaccum. These different speeds are inversly proportional to a materials index of refraction. 

In this report, the index of refraction is calculated for air, helium, argon and nitrogen. These were determined by examining the gases at different pressures in an Michelson interferometer.
